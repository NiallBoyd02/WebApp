             <p>If you are using Royal Mail, EVRi or InPost the tracking will show it delivered to our nearest distribution centre. We’ll email you as soon as your parcel arrives back at our warehouse, and again when we have processed your refund.</p>
            <p>If you paid for your order with a gift voucher a replacement to the value of the refund will be issued. If we receive your return outside of the returns policy timeframe, you may also receive your refund as a voucher.</p>
            <p>If you've waited more than 28 days with no email from us, please get in touch by going to the Contact Us tab on this page. </p>
